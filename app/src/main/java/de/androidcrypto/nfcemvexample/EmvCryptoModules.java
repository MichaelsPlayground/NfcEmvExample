/**
 * This class has all methods to run cryptographic on emv cards
 * Most of the methods are taken from Johannes Zweng's EmvKeyReader.java:
 * https://github.com/johnzweng/android-emv-key-test/blob/master/app/src/main/java/at/zweng/emv/keys/EmvKeyReader.java
 * Some methods are modified to be suited to this program, e.g. this app doesn't read the CA-keys from a file but from
 * a service class that hold some of the keys needed for my tests.
